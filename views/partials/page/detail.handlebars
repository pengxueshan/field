        <h1>Exploring Elm - Part 2</h1>
        <div class="article-content">
            <p>In the previous article we took a look at Elm and how we can structure Elm applications. It is important to divide logic into different files and allow views to share state and trigger any actions to change the state in the application. This is based on ideas from Flux, which allows us to structure and scale applications without causing a lot of pain.</p>
